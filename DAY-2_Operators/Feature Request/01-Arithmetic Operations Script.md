```JS
// Define two numbers
let number1 = 12;
let number2 = 5;

// Perform basic arithmetic operations
let addition = number1 + number2;
let subtraction = number1 - number2;
let multiplication = number1 * number2;
let division = number1 / number2;
let remainder = number1 % number2;

// Log the results to the console
console.log("Addition: " + number1 + " + " + number2 + " = " + addition);
console.log("Subtraction: " + number1 + " - " + number2 + " = " + subtraction);
console.log("Multiplication: " + number1 + " * " + number2 + " = " + multiplication);
console.log("Division: " + number1 + " / " + number2 + " = " + division);
console.log("Remainder: " + number1 + " % " + number2 + " = " + remainder);
```

### Explanation

You can run this code in any JavaScript environment, such as a web browser's console or a Node.js runtime.
