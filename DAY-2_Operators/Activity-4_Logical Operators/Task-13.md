```JS
// Define a condition
let condition = true;

// Negate the condition using !
let negatedCondition = !condition;

// Log the original and negated conditions to the console
console.log("The original condition is: " + condition);
console.log("The negated condition is: " + negatedCondition);

// Example with numbers
let number = 10;

// Check if the number is not greater than 5
let isNotGreaterThanFive = !(number > 5);

// Log the result to the console
console.log(number + " is not greater than 5: " + isNotGreaterThanFive);
```

### Explanation

You can run this code in any JavaScript environment, such as a web browser's console or a Node.js runtime.
